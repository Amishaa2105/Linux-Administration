Experiment 2: View the gedit man page. Use the man -k ext4 command to find the command to tune ext4 file-system parameters. Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the text that precedes or follows the brace definition. Implementation: man gedit
